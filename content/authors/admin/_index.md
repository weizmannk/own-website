# About Michael


Ramodgwendé Weizmann Kiendrébéogo followed a scientific curriculum during which I acquired solid skills in mathematics, physics, as well as in computer programming, before going on to a Master's degree in Materials and Astrophysics in order to do a thesis in the field of relativistic astrophysics.        
As a graduate student à l'Université Joseph Ki-Zerbo, I have modeled the image of the compact object M87* at the center of the galaxy M87 observed in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) millimeter array, comparing the images predicted when M87* is considered to be a spinning Kerr black hole or a spinning Hayward-Lamy wormhole (one of the possible alternatives to black holes) at LESIA / Observatoire de Paris.
Winner of the Henri Poincaré Junior grant, in 2020, of Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, I had the opportunity to work on, Gravitational Waves, Compact Binary Coalescences with extreme masses and wormholes, the stochastic background of gravitational waves, and active galactic nuclei.
I am a PhD student, working in the field of Gravitational Waves and Multimessengers, to this end I'm evolving in the Virgo collaboration, where I am involving, to update and newly built code-bases and develope the improvements to enable others coincident gravitational wave - electromagnetic counterpart for the upcoming fourth and fifth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, as well as the GW170817 event.
